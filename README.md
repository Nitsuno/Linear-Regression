# Linear-Regression
Building a linear regression model only using numpy for self study purpose

This is a (work in progress) linear regression model aimed at representing bivariate and/or multivariate data in a linear regression graph

Dataset used is 'data.csv', rewriting data within it will not give unexpected output as long as it is in csv (comma separated value) format

Run the 'plot.py' file
```
python plot.py
```
